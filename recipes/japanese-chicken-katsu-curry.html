      What better way is there to unwind after a long day than with a
      flavoursome Japanese katsu curry? Curry was introduced to Japan by the
      British over 100 years ago, and has since then become one of the countryâ€™s
      favourite dishes to make at home. This recipe combines thick curry sauce
      with a crisp fried chicken cutlet, perfect for serving on a bed of rice
      with half a hard boiled egg and a little pickled radish.

      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>&frac34; cup apple juice</li>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the curry sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over
        medium-high heat. Add the onions and spend 8-10 minutes stirring and
        sweating them down until they&apos;re sweet and translucent &#40;but not
        browned&#41;. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the plain
        flour and cook, stirring for another minute. Then stir through the curry
        powder and garam masala. Add the vinegar and honey. Then add the chicken
        stock, apple juice and ginger. Stir until well combined. Add the carrot
        and simmer for 20 minutes or until the carrot is tender and the flavours
        are well developed. Then stir through the cornflour mixture. Simmer for
        a further minute to thicken. Taste and season with salt to taste. Keep
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the curry sauce is simmering, you can crumb and cook your chicken
        cutlets. Season each piece of chicken with salt. Place the flour, eggs
        and breadcrumbs in separate large bowls or trays. Coat each piece of
        chicken in flour, then egg and then in the breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat about a 2cm depth of oil in the bottom of a large frying pan over
        medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the cutlets &#40;do this in
        batches if necessary&#41; and cook for about 4 minutes each side or
        until the cutlets are golden and the chicken is cooked through. Transfer
        to paper towel to drain and season with a little salt while warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to serve, cut the cutlets into slices. Divide the rice among
        serving plates. Top with the chicken slices. And pour over the curry
        sauce. Add pickled ginger if using.
